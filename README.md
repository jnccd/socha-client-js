This repository contains a random client for the game "Hey, Danke f√ºr den Fisch" written for Node JS.

Because it is a random client, it will only do seemingly random moves. If you wish to build your own client on top of this one you can follow the instructions below. 

## Usage

You can either [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or download it as an archive using the green `<> Code` button in the top right.

Both approaches require you to have the [Node.js Version 18](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.9.0/) installed!

Once everything is prepared you can add your code to the `logic.js` file using any IDE you like, however I would recommend Visual Studio Code.

To run this project write the following in the console:

```node main.js```

If you wish to pass program arguments to the `node ` execution you can use `--` like so:

```node main.js -- --help```
